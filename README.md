# AO2 — AI Warranty Scanner  
*A web app that scans, extracts, and tracks warranty expiry dates using OCR, GPT, and Firebase.*

## Overview  
Consumers often lose warranty receipts or forget expiry dates, leading to:
- Missed repair claims  
- Extra replacement costs  
- No central place to store warranty information  

**Warranty Keeper solves this by:**
- Scanning handwritten or printed warranties  
- Using OCR + GPT to extract product name, purchase date, warranty length, etc.  
- Storing all warranties securely under a user’s login  
- Displaying expiry dates visually on a smart calendar
